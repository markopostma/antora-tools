= Quickstart

This guide walks you through enabling the extension and generating your first set of GraphQL API docs from a schema or introspection query.

== Enable

=== For a single project

[source,yml]
.Single project configuration
----
antora:
  extensions:
    - require: '@antora-tools/graphql'
      strategy: <Strategy>
      location: <String>
----

=== For multiple projects

[source,yml]
.Multi project configuration
----
antora:
  extensions:
    - require: '@antora-tools/graphql'
      components:
        - strategy: FILE 
          location: 'my-types.graphql'
        - strategy: INTROSPECTION
          location: 'https://host.com/graphql'
        - strategy: URL
          location: 'https://host.com/schema.graphql'
          version: '1.0.0'
----
This allows you to provide an array of components. Mixing up different strategies is not supposed to be a problem. Each component has it's own dedicated configuration set.

== Generation

With the extension enabled the time has come to build the Antora project with the new settings. 

[source,bash]
----
npx antora {your-playbook}.yml
----

If all went well, the result should be something as:

  Generated 34 pages in 123ms
