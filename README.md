## Development

This project uses `esbuild` to transpile TypeScript code into JavaScript to make it suitable for an Antora environment. All packages in `packages/*` that need to be published to NPM and consumed as JavaScript are built this way.

### Install

```bash
npm ci
```

### Scripts

The root `package.json` defines some common scripts:

```json
{
  "build": "npm run build -ws --if-present",
  "clean": "npm run clean -ws --if-present",
  "test": "npm test -ws --if-present"
}
```

The `-ws` and `--if-present` flags tell npm to execute the command from the working directory of each package, only if the script is present.

#### `build`

Build all workspaces:

```bash
npm run build
```

Build for a single workspace:

```bash
npm run build -w @antora-tools/graphql
```

Or watch for changes:

```bash
npm run build -w @antora-tools/graphql -- --watch
```

#### `clean`

Clean all workspaces:

```bash
npm run clean
```

#### `test`

Test all workspaces with `jest`:

```bash
npm run test
```
