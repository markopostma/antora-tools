= Auto-Generate API Docs from a Schema or an IntrospectionQuery.

[.lead]
**The Antora GraphQL Extension transforms your GraphQL schema or introspection query into clear, navigable, and beautifully integrated API docsâ€”right inside your Antora site.**

Whether you're managing a rapidly evolving API or just want to keep docs close to your code, this extension bridges the gap between your schema and your documentation, making it a lot easier to keep things in sync.

- [x] Generates in-memory `.adoc` documents using your existing Antora pipeline.
- [x] Nifty auto generated **query** and **response** examples.
- [x] You're able to enrich code examples and documentation.
- [x] Easy to configure and customize ðŸ›
