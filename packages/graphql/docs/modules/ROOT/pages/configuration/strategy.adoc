= Strategy

Currently `<<_file>>`, `<<_url>>` and `<<_introspection>>` are supported strategies.

== `FILE`

Apply this strategy when a GraphQL schema is accessible locally. Expects a _relative_ path to one or more schema files. For example:

- `./relative-path-to/schema.graphql`
- `./relative-path-to/*.graphql`

== `URL`

Apply this strategy when a GraphQL schema is accessible remotely via **HTTP** by POST or GET. Expects an _URL_ to an endpoint that serves a `.graphql` file. For example:

- `https://somehost.com/schema.graphql`
- `https://somehost.com/schema`

== `INTROSPECTION`

Apply this strategy when a GraphQL endpoint is accessible remotely via **HTTP** by POST or GET. Expects an _URL_ to a GraphQL endpoint. For example:

- `https://somehost.com/graphql`
