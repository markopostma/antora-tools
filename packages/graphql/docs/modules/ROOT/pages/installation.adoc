= Installation

[.lead]
The Antora GraphQL Extension is distributed as an npm package, making it easy to integrate into any Node.js-based documentation workflow â€” whether you're working in a standalone Antora site or a monorepo with multiple extensions.

[TIP,caption="Prerequisites"]
====
- [x] Node.js v20^+^
- [x] Antora installed (locally or globally)
- [x] Access to a *valid* GraphQL schema (.graphql) or graphQL endpoint that supports link:https://graphql.org/learn/introspection/[introspection,window=_blank].
====

== Install via npm

In your Antora project directory (or the root of your monorepo):

[source,bash]
----
npm install --save-dev @antora-tools/graphql
----

== Install via yarn

[source,bash]
----
yarn add -D @antora-tools/graphql
----

This will install the extension as a dev dependency.

== Using Workspaces or a Monorepo?

If you're using an link:https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/using-npm/workspaces[npm workspace,window=_blank], you can add the extension to a specific workspace, like so:

[source,bash]
----
npm install --workspace packages/docs @antora-tools/graphql --save-dev
----
